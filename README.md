# MassetDL
Mass asset downloader for Roblox assets. Inspired by [Iris's Asset Downloader](https://github.com/IrisV3rm/AssetDownloader) with the appeal of being more efficient. 
# Usage
Does not require you to specify the asset's type as it will find it on its own.
Simply have an `assets.txt` file with the asset ID on each line for example:
```
123
456
789
```
